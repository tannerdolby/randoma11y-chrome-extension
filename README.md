# Random A11y Chrome Extension
Toggle a randoma11y theme for your webpage in Chrome. View the available themes from the extensions popup UI. The contrast ratio for each theme is shown inside each grid item.

After selecting a theme in the popup UI, the WCAG AA/AAA information becomes available.

## Notes

This extension performs a "blanket" theme transformation which looks good generally to preview a specific theme. But I cannot guarantee every webpage will allow for the theme to be provided in a accessible fashion. 

Note: Use this extension as a "preview" or "demo" for a specific theme and then go checkout the color palette separately in your own development for the best user experience.

Todo:
- Handle hover states
